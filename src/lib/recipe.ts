/**
 * Totals a recipe's ingredients and divides by its serving count. Cost is
 * only included when every priced ingredient shares one currency — mixing
 * currencies can't be summed into a single meaningful per-serve cost.
 *
 * The energy total is displayed in whichever unit (cal/kJ) the recipe's own
 * ingredients contribute the most energy in — not just whichever unit makes
 * the number look biggest — so a recipe built mostly from kJ-labeled foods
 * displays in kJ, and one built mostly from cal-labeled foods displays in
 * cal, regardless of a stray ingredient using the other unit.
 *
 * `currentFoods` (a foodId -> current food record lookup) lets this
 * recompute each ingredient's nutrition from the food's live data and the
 * amount actually listed in the recipe, rather than trusting whatever
 * energy/macro numbers happen to be frozen on the recipe's stored snapshot
 * — those are only ever as correct as they were the moment the recipe was
 * last saved. Ingredients missing from `currentFoods` (food deleted, or the
 * lookup omitted) fall back to the recipe's own stored snapshot as-is.
